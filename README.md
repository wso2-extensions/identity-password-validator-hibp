# WSO2 Identity Server - Have I Been Pwned Breach Source

A breach-intelligence source for WSO2 Identity Server that checks candidate passwords against the
[Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) Pwned Passwords corpus.

It implements the `BreachSource` contract published by Identity Server's breached credential detection, and
registers itself as an OSGi service. Enforcement, ordering, failure policy, telemetry and user-facing
messaging all belong to the product; this connector's only job is to answer whether a password is in the
corpus, or to say clearly that it could not tell.

## Requirements

- WSO2 Identity Server with breached credential detection (the `org.wso2.carbon.identity.breach.detection`
  bundles) present.
- Maven 3.x, JDK 11 or higher.
- No API key. The Pwned Passwords range endpoint requires no authentication. A key is supported for
  subscribers, and a missing one is never treated as a reason to stop checking.

## Installation

```bash
mvn clean install
cp components/org.wso2.identity.password.validator.hibp/target/org.wso2.identity.password.validator.hibp.component-*.jar \
   <IS-HOME>/repository/components/dropins/
```

Restart the server. The connector registers itself; there is no configuration file to edit for it to appear.
The server log records the bound sources and their priorities on startup:

```
Breach source bound: id=hibp, priority=500. Bound sources are now [localList@100, hibp@500].
The Have I Been Pwned connector was configured: endpoint=https://api.pwnedpasswords.com/range/,
readTimeout=1500 ms, apiKey=not set.
```

## Configuration

Operator settings are properties of the breach detection listener in `deployment.toml`, named
`sources.hibp.<property>`. Every key is optional.

```toml
[[event_listener]]
id = "breach_detection"
type = "org.wso2.carbon.user.core.listener.UserOperationEventListener"
name = "org.wso2.carbon.identity.breach.detection.listener.BreachDetectionListener"
order = 420
enable = true
properties."sources.hibp.api_key" = "$secret{hibp_api_key}"   # optional; vault-resolved, never returned by any API
properties."sources.hibp.base_url" = "https://api.pwnedpasswords.com/range/"
properties."sources.hibp.read_timeout_ms" = 1500
properties."sources.hibp.connect_timeout_ms" = 1000
properties."sources.hibp.retries" = 1
```

> **Quote the keys.** Written unquoted, as `properties.sources.hibp.read_timeout_ms`, the config parser
> renders the whole group as a single property holding a map and this connector never receives it. The server
> logs a warning naming the key it ignored.

The `$secret{alias}` value is resolved by the config parser before it reaches the connector, so the alias
text never enters this bundle.

Whether the source is consulted is this connector's own per-organization setting, published as a governance
connector under **Password Security**. Because the connector publishes it, the setting appears in the Console
when this bundle is installed and disappears when it is removed - no product change is involved either way.

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `hibp.enable` | `false` | Consult this source for the organization. |
| `__secret__hibp.apiKey` | `none` | The key to present for this organization. Optional - see below. |
| `hibp.refuseWhenUnreachable` | `false` | Refuse the password when this service cannot answer, rather than letting it through. |

```http
PATCH /api/server/v1/identity-governance/{category}/connectors/{connector}
{"operation":"UPDATE","properties":[{"name":"hibp.enable","value":"true"}]}
```

The two switches are booleans on purpose. The Console's generic connector form picks a toggle when a
property's value is `true` or `false` and a text box otherwise, so a setting modelled as an enumeration would
make an administrator type `allow` or `deny` by hand.

The API key carries the platform's `__secret__` prefix, the same convention the shipped Sift and ELK
connectors use. That is what makes the Console render it as a password field rather than a plain text box.

**A key is optional** - the range endpoint this connector calls is free and unauthenticated. An
organization's own key wins; the deployment-wide `api_key` above is the fallback; and with neither set the
source still checks every password. A missing key silently disabling the check is the 1.x failure this
connector exists to avoid.

The key defaults to the literal `none` rather than to an empty string, and `none` is treated as no key at
all. That is a workaround for the Console, not a preference. The generic connector form marks every text
field `required` with no way for a connector to opt out:

```tsx
// dynamic-connector-form.tsx
<Field ... required={ true } validate={ [ required ] } />
```

An empty API key therefore makes the browser refuse to submit the form, so an administrator without a key
could not change the two switches either. A default that is never empty keeps the form usable. `normalizeApiKey`
is the single place that maps blank and `none` to no key, and it is covered by a test - if the placeholder
ever reached the wire it would be sent to the service as a credential.

The shipped Sift connector has exactly this shape - `__secret__.sift.api.key`, defaulted to `""` and marked
confidential - and avoids the problem only because `SIFT_CONNECTOR_ID` has a case in `connector-form-factory.tsx`
that routes it to a hand-written form. This connector deliberately requires no Console change, so it takes the
placeholder instead.

**Know where the key is readable.** A governance property marked confidential is still returned in full by
`GET /identity-governance/{category}/connectors` - we confirmed this against a running server. Marking it
confidential keeps it out of the unauthenticated preferences endpoint, and nothing more. Anyone holding
`internal_idp_view` can read the key back. That is a property of the platform's connector API, not of this
connector, and it applies equally to the shipped connectors that store keys the same way. If that is not
acceptable in your deployment, put the key in `deployment.toml` behind the secret store and leave the
per-organization field empty.

The Console renders these in the order above, and that is why the connector is named `have-i-been-pwned`
rather than `hibp`. When a connector's name is a prefix of its property names, `getConnectorListWithConfigs`
matches every same-prefixed property on the first pass and emits them in the order the platform's property
map happens to yield - a `HashMap` keyed by property name, so the order is arbitrary and shifts as other
connectors are installed. Keeping the connector name outside the property namespace means each property is
matched on its own pass and `getPropertyNames()` decides the order.

## How it works

The candidate password is hashed with SHA-1 in process. The first five characters of the digest are sent to
the range endpoint; the remaining thirty-five never leave the deployment. The endpoint returns every suffix in
that bucket — roughly eight hundred of them — and the match is made locally, so the service never learns the
answer to its own query. `Add-Padding` is sent on every request so the response size does not reveal how many
entries a bucket holds.

Nothing is held between calls. Each check is answered from a fresh range lookup, so the connector keeps no
password material in memory at all.

> Range responses are cacheable in principle — a bucket is stable for hours and is shared by every password in
> it — but caching is deferred to a later iteration. A five-character prefix covers one of 1,048,576 buckets
> and each one costs about 116 KB to hold, so a cache large enough to hit usefully does not fit the heap. If
> it comes back it must be sized for a resubmitted password, not for a shared corpus.

The call is bounded by an explicit connect and read timeout and a retry count, so a failing endpoint costs a
bounded wait per write and never hangs. Every failure — timeout, transport, quota, parse — is treated as
*could not check* and never as *not found*. What that means for the password is the deployment's decision,
not this connector's.

> An outage currently costs that bounded wait on **every** password write. Suppressing the call after repeated
> failures, so an outage costs one timeout rather than one per write, is deferred to a later iteration.

## Upgrading from 1.x

1.x was not a breach source. It registered a governance connector and an HTTP servlet, and hooked no
credential-write path, so it could not refuse a password being set. 2.0 replaces that entirely.

| 1.x | 2.0 |
|---|---|
| `/hibp` servlet taking a plaintext password | Removed. Nothing here accepts a password from a caller. |
| `[[resource.access_control]]` with `secure = false` | No longer required, and should be removed. |
| `hibp.password.validator.*` governance connector | Replaced by `breachDetection.*`, which covers every source. |
| Blank API key reported every password as clean, while presenting as enabled | The range endpoint needs no key; a missing key changes nothing. |
| No enforcement | Enforced by the product's listener on every password-setting path. |

**If you are running 1.x, remove the `(.*)/hibp(.*)` access-control entry from `deployment.toml`.** While it is
present, the 1.x servlet accepts a plaintext password from an unauthenticated caller.

The live "check as you type" behaviour the 1.x servlet existed for is deliberately not reintroduced. A browser
that wants it can query the range endpoint directly with a hash prefix, so Identity Server never sees the
password at all.

## Building a source of your own

`BreachSource` is a published contract. Implement it and register the service:

```java
bundleContext.registerService(BreachSource.class, new MySource(), null);
```

The contract is versioned on its own compatibility rather than on the product's release number, so a connector
importing `[1.0,2.0)` keeps resolving across product minors and majors.

All five methods are abstract: `getId`, `getPriority`, `configure`, `isEnabled` and `check`. The interface was
reduced to what the engine actually calls, so there is nothing optional left to default. An additive revision
would add a default method rather than an abstract one, so an existing connector keeps compiling.
